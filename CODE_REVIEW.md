## Findings
1. This utility overlaps other '*-tools' repos (file-tools, json-tools, netally-tools …); consider consolidating functionality into a modular multi-tool to reduce duplicated scaffolding.

_Python-specific_: Target CPython 3.14 compatibility (type hints, stdlib changes, WASI builds). Enforce PEP8/PEP257, prefer Ruff/Black, and keep type hints complete for production readiness.
_C/C++ guidance_: Adopt modern C23/C++23 toolchains (enable -std=c2x / -std=c++23 plus sanitizers).
